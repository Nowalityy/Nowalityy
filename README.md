# **Hey there!**

<ins>I’m **Nowality!**</ins>
A Full-Stack developer based in France.

I code and build whatever I can imagine.
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll code it and deploy it.

My main tech stack is React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
My favorite tools are VSCode, Git, and Docker.

I have a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is my latest project with Percisio.
I’ve built some public repos—and many more privately.

Fun Facts:

-I'm 20 years old  
-I don’t like coffee  
-I don't smoke  
-One Piece is my favorite anime  
**Hobbies**: Anime, coding, MMA
